# Manage your project for Microsoft Global Hackathon 2022

<!--step0-->
If you have an interesting idea, and you proposed it as a project in [Hackbox](https://hackbox.microsoft.com/) now it's time to start working on it to make it a reality, throgh this template repo with guide on many resources you can leverage to implement your project. It's important to mention that is not necesary to implement fully the project, you can show a prototype, demo proyect, etc. 

Important considerations to use properly this template:

- **Who is this for**: Hackers, Influencesr, Advisors that will participate in Microsoft Global Hackathon in Mexico Venue.
- **What's available in this repo template?**: Documents and guidelines that help you to conceptualize your idea using design thinking practices and artifacts, ppt templates, recommended tools, prototyping practices and resources to work on your project.
- **Prerequisites**: If you need to learn about Design thinking, planning your project on Github/Azure DevOps/Microsoft Planner you can look at:.

## How to start

1. Above these instructions, right-click **Use this template** and open the link in a new tab.
   ![Use this template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/169618716-fb17528d-f332-4fc5-a11a-eaa23562665e.png)
2. In the new tab, follow the prompts to create a new repository.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a private/internal repositories.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step recomendations in the new repository's README.

Using Design thinking could be useful to develop your ideas for your project, this only an approach, a guide; exists several techniques that you can use.

<!--Step 1-->

<summary><h2>Step 1: Identify value for user </h2></summary>

### Value for Users 

Identify the jobs to be done:
1. Gains: Describe the results that the customer wish to achieve or the specific benefits the customer is looking for.
2. Customer Jobs: Describe what the customer is trying to obtain/achieve in their work and in his/her life
3. Pains: Describe the negative results, the risks and obstacles related to the customer work

<summary><h2>Step 2: Value Propositions</h2></summary>

### Value Propositions

Once that you know the customer needs with the Value for users analysis now it's time to identify how youcan solve them:

1. Gain Creators : Describe how you can create profits/Wows for your customer.
2. Products & services : List the products and services that you will offer to the customer 
3. Pain Relievers : Describe how you can relieve the pain for the customer.

Be Descriptive your value proposition consider include in an document the following structure and elements:

1. Title/Header: Describe the final benefit that you offer to the Cx.
2. Subtitle/Paragraph: Detailed explanation of what are you offering, who is the customer and why. 
3. 3 points: List of benefits and features.
4. Visual Element: Show video, pptx, images to enforce the message.
   
Something that helps you to elaborate your value proposition is try to answer the following questions: 
- Who is my value proposition addressed to?
- Do I understand the Benefits, profits, pains and Jobs of this Customer?
- Do am I proposing Pain Relievers and Gain Creators that matters to my Cx?
- Is this proposal different of the competitors?
- Am I formulating my proposal in a clear way?
- It sounds as something my Cx would understand?

<summary><h2>Step 3: Work on a prototype</h2></summary>

### Prototyping
   
Prototyping is an essential step in the Design Thinking process and is often used in the final testing phase. Every product has a target audience and is designed to solve their problems in some way. To assess whether a product really solves its users' problems, designers create an almost-working model or mock-up of the product, called a prototype, and test it with prospective users and stakeholders.
   
The following prototype techniques could be helpfull in your project: 
   
- Sketches and Diagrams : Perhaps the most basic form of prototyping, sketching, requires minimal effort and does not necessarily require artistic drawing skills to serve its purpose. Use sketches to begin the process of conceptualizing and building a new product and share the concept with teammates for more ideas and discussions. 

- Paper Interface : Digital products, especially websites, mobile apps, web services, and other screen-related products, require a range of prototyping methods en route to the final design and development. Paper interfaces prove to be handy for early-stage prototyping for digital products. You can sketch paper interfaces or draw and cut out usable parts of a user interface like a drop-down menu or text field. 

- Storyboards : Storyboarding is an excellent way of telling stories and guiding targeted customers through a user experience. A technique to be used for early prototyping, storyboards allow you to visualize how users would experience a problem or product and present it in a series of images or sketches. Stories help us gather information on users, tasks, and goals while at the same time evoking new ideas through collaboration with other designers. Drawing out a user's experience helps us better understand their world and to think from their perspective. 

- Role-Playing : Role-playing or experiential prototyping enables designers to explore situations within the system that you're targeting physically. Role-playing can be best used in capturing and enacting the user's experience of using a product or service. Consider simulating their experience to gain an empathic understanding of users. You can create props, use objects and audio simulations to imitate the user environment. 
   
- Physical Models : For a physical product, you can use a wide variety of materials to build a prototype for testing. Physical models are often built using paper, cardboard, clay, foam, or by repurposing existing objects. A physical model is used to bring an intangible idea into a physical, three-dimensional form. This enables much better user testing and can evoke discussions on the form factor of the proposed product. 

- Wizard of Oz Prototypes : Prototypes with faked functions that you can use to test users are called Wizard of Oz Prototypes. Like in the wizard of Oz story where the wizard creates an ominous, deceptive appearance from behind a screen â€“ this prototype allows you to mimic certain aspects of your product to save time and resources. For example, interactivity that comes from a human and not an algorithm can be tweaked such that users believe the latter is the case. The most famous example of Wizard of Oz Prototypes is a digital system prototype, where the user is tricked into believing that the system responses are computer-generated when they are human-controlled. 

- User-Driven Prototypes : A user-driven prototype does not test on users but allows the user to create some design, so you learn more about their thinking. This type of prototyping adds to the benefits of design thinking. Its purpose is not to use the user-generated solutions but to use their designs to gain empathy with them or fine-tune your product according to their ideas.

<summary><h2>Step 4: Use an agile methodology</h2></summary>

### Agile methodology 
Use an agile methodology to work on your project, it will help you to plan and organize the work that you have to do to implement a solution. 
You can use to manage all you backlog the following tools:
   - Azure Devops Boards : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards?view=azure-devops
   - GitHub Projects : https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects
   - Microsoft Planner : https://www.microsoft.com/es-mx/microsoft-365/business/task-management-software
